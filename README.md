## Chat Application with React and Firebase
https://heybud.netlify.app

This is a chat application powered by React, Firebase and skypack.dev However, it hasn't reached its full potential due to certain limitations. Firstly, I developed the entire application using my smartphone, which is not an ideal setup for such a project. 

Secondly, because of the constraints imposed by my phone, I had to employ certain manipulative techniques to ensure the app's functionality. For instance, I had to use React's `createElement` instead of JSX, which made the code difficult to maintain. Additionally, I had to resort to an alternative to Material UI called MD Bootstrap, as I was unable to use the actual Material UI.

The app currently offers only basic chatting functionality and lacks advanced features. Its performance, accessibility, and security may be subpar as a result. Achieving excellence in these areas proved challenging with just an Android phone at my disposal.
